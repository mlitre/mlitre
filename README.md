Hello, my name is Martin Litre. I am software engineer currently living near Paris, France. 
I am an IoT enthusiast with a particular interest in communication protocols.
I currently work at [Trialog](https://www.trialog.com/en/home/) where I am the lead developer and maintainer of a C++ software library for [OCPP](https://openchargealliance.org/protocols/open-charge-point-protocol/), as well as a developer of EV charging station software and ISO 15118 C++ library.

I am currently learning rust and interested in Zig and Go.
I am generally curious and like experimenting / exploring new technologies.
I am also looking at starting a blog to write about my learnings.
